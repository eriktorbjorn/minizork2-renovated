## Size-optimized version

The mini2.z3 file in this directory is functionally equivalent to the
standard version, but has been built with better abbreviations
(mini2_freq.xzap) than what ZILF 0.9 generates. This may be useful
when creating versions for 8-bit computers.

The abbreviations where generated by [Henrik
Ã…sman](https://github.com/heasm66/mini_zork_2_z3)

## Commodore versions

Commodore versions were provided by Fredrik Ramsberg, using the [Ozmoo
Z-Machine interpreter](https://github.com/johanberntsson/ozmoo). At
the time of writing, the original files were hosted on [Google
Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XOcXwgEb9J88MLPxtC4TbCbKsZFR_TJf),
but were included here, with kind permission, for your convenience.

## The map

The map.json and map.png files were generated with
[Trizbort.io](http://www.trizbort.io). The map is not as pretty as it
could be, but it should be reasonably accurate.
