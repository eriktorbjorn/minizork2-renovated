## Size-optimized abbreviations

The mini2_freq.xzap file can be used to build a version of the game
that is approximately 700 bytes smaller than the one generated by ZILF
0.9. This has been to successfully build a single-file version for the
C64, i.e. one that should be possible to run from a cassette.

It's been generated from Release 14 of the game by [Henrik Ã…sman](https://github.com/heasm66/mini_zork_2_z3)

## The map

The map.json and map.png files were generated with [Trizbort.io](http://www.trizbort.io). The map is not as pretty as it could be, but it should be reasonably complete.
